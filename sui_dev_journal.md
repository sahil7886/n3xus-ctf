# My Sui Dev Journal

## Challenge 0
1. The download process was quick and was pretty straightforward. 
2. Pretty much just had to add the Move extension to my IDE
3. Was a bit confusing. Didn't understand what the keypair scheme flag is. I ran `sui client` first and it asked me whether I wanted to connect to a full node server, which I wasn't sure about. 
4. I used the website. It was annoying that it rate-limited me after just 1 dispense. I waited a bit and got another token.
5. The `sui move new` command worked perfect. Understanding the structure of the package and how it worked was a bit confusing since I'm new to Move/Rust.
6. I had an 'insufficient gas' issue when using the gas budget argument. However, when I tried running just `sui client publish`, it worked perfectly.

### Summary
The setup was fairly easy, considering it was my first time using Move. Had a few minor issues but overall, pretty smooth.

## Challenge 1
1. Reading and understanding the repo was fairly easy. I used Suiscan to find the vault code and object id.
2. Implementing this was difficult. I repeatedly got the 'UnusedValueWithoutDrop' error and faced a lot of bugs.
